# MEDPL-150---Interactive-Story-Assignment
A web-based, non-linear interactive story, where players can make choices that affect how the game will end. This game will take inspiration from the analog horror series "Vita Carnis" by Youtuber "Darian Quilloy", in what type of threats the players will face in the game. I make no claim of ownership over any of the monsters or artwork.
